Suggestions: 

- Custom battle instead of 2 agent types just 1 with a variant selector like the shaman mages, to prevent flooding the custom battle menu
- Change the quest for bjornling capture pack ice bay reward to a skald (random). This will allow them to get one before Tier IV, which is a long time in their case.
- Add unique skill line to tier 1 and perhaps add the passive abilities as character skill unlocks. 
- Add generic item to battle item setpiece character like a potion of strength or toughness.
