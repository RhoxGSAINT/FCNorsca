2024/MAY/01 SCM - HKrul

- Added missing UI Bullet Points for Skald characters
- Slightly shortened short unit description for skalds
- Fixed an issue where Skald variants had different charge bonusses (40 and 30)
- Fixed an issue where the Skald variants had a difference in total stats (42 / 37 and 48 / 32)
- Increase Skald's HP to have them scale into late game better (as they have no mounts)
- Fixed a typo in Skalds Agent actions and changed the titles to reflect their archetype.
- Added new and worse melee weapon for Skalds to balance with Deco's Jarl champion hero.
- Added two new abilities for Skalds. One passive per variant.
- Created unique icons for Skalds abilities and one for Oerl's horn.
- Changed a loc in Oerl's abilities that wrongfully refered to Huern the Wolf

Suggestions: 

- Custom battle instead of 2 agent types just 1 with a variant selector like the shaman mages, to prevent flooding the custom battle menu
- Change the quest for bjornling capture pack ice bay reward to a skald (random). This will allow them to get one before Tier IV, which is a long time in their case.
- Add unique skill line to tier 1 and perhaps add the passive abilities as character skill unlocks. 
- Add generic item to battle item setpiece character like a potion of strength or toughness.
