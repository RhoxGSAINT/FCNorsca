building_short_description_texts_short_description_rhox_fc_norsca_kai_delta_swamp	The southern extreme of the Sarl Coast is the Kalti Delta and its eponymous river. The Kalti Delta is a huge salt marsh, expanding inland into an even larger freshwater one. The river itself later splits but goes nowhere of note; it's just a route inland. The marsh is a mystery, as few dare the dangers of River Trolls without good cause. Anything could be in there, a compelling reason for exploration.	false
