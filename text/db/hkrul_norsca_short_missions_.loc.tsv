missions_localised_description_hkrul_bjornling_ulfric_crown_final_battle	The frozen shores of Skjold, once a bastion of Norscan strength, now bear witness to the looming storm on the horizon. Ulfric Grondal, High King of the Bjornling Tribe, learns of a relentless menace approaching his domain, a shadow from his past turned seafaring legendâ€”Aranessa Saltspite. Rumors of his mutant daughter's return reach the ears of tribes already swayed by doubts about his rule. With the mantle of leadership hanging by a thread, Ulfric faces an unavoidable reckoning. He cannot allow Aranessa's piracy to undermine his authority any further. To reclaim the respect of his jarls and huskarls, he must confront the wayward daughter he once cast into the abyss. As the frigid wind howls and the unforgiving sea churns, Ulfric Grondal rides to the icy shores, a realm he must defend to retain his high kingship. The burden of a father's choice and the weight of an unspoken fate converge in this bitter conflict. The battlefield becomes the crucible in which Ulfric aims to sever the ties that bind him to the pirate queen and reassert his claim as the one true High King of the Bjornling Tribe.	false
