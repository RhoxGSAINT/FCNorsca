unit_description_historical_texts_text_hkrul_grydal	Grydal is not the first jarl of the Snaegr, but he may well be the last who draws breath. A warlord born of endless raids, blood-feuds, and ice-bound desperation, he forged his reputation not with boasts but with results: burned villages, broken tribes, and a shieldwall that does not yield. The Snaegr once scrounged the edges of Norsca, feared more for their madness than their strength. But under Grydal, they became something more — unrelenting. Some whisper that he speaks to ancestors, that the moon of Urlf burns brighter when he chants. Grydal does not deny it. He simply tightens his grip on his axe and marches southward.	false

ancillaries_colour_text_hkrul_grydal_axe	Forged in a forgotten age from star-metal and quenched in the blood-fires of a ruined southern hold, Brisingr's Oath is no mere axe — it is a beacon of destruction. The blade never cools. It burns not with magical flame, but with something older, more hateful. Its edge is blackened steel, yet red-hot to the touch, and it devours the flesh and souls of those it cleaves.	false

effect_bundles_localised_description_hkrul_grydal_faction_trait	Born of blood and black ice, the Snaegr heed no jarl but the Blood God.

unit_description_short_texts_text_hkrul_urf	Clad in ruin and crowned in rage, the Scourge has become what his blood always promised — the Exalted Fang of Urlfdaemonkin.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_hkrul_urf	Once, Grydal was merely the most violent of men — Jarl of the Snaegr, butcher of the southern tribes, and wielder of a flame-wreathed axe. But his blood carried a darker inheritance, one older than his name: the cursed ichor of Urlfdaemonkin, the Daemon Prince who first led the Snaegr into Khorne's embrace. Through massacre and moon-rites, skull-thrones and rivers of offering, Grydal won his ancestor’s gaze. Beneath the Moon of Urlf, in a storm of blood and fire, he accepted the final blessing. His flesh tore, then reknit. His axe burned brighter. His roar shattered stone. Now he walks the world as no mere champion, but as Khorne’s incarnate wrath — a being of molten rage and daemonic fury. Horned, clawed, and thrumming with the power of the Blood God, he leads the Snaegr as a living herald of their bloody destiny. Where he treads, the snow melts, the land cracks, and gods look away.	false
frontend_faction_leaders_loading_screen_text_cr_oldworld_political_party_nor_snaegr	The shame of defeat festers in Grydal’s veins. The Hall of the Snaegr, throne of his ancestors, lies occupied — not by the strong, but by Skaeling carrion. He will take it back, aye... but only as the first step. For Grydal is no mere chieftain. He is heir to Urlfdaemonkin — the first of their line to shed mortality and wear rage as a second skin. Now, Khorne watches. The blood must flow. Skulls must pile. And to the south, legends await — waiting to be broken, drowned in flame, and ground beneath an axe of burning wrath. This is not conquest. This is ascension.	false

incidents_localised_description_hkrul_grydal_turn_two_incident	The Hall of the Snaegr burns — its bone-marked gates shattered, its skull-thrones defiled by Skaeling boots. Egil Styrbjorn, pretender and glory-thief, now squats in your ancestral seat, drinking your mead and mocking your name. The gods watch in silence. Urlfdaemonkin watches in judgment. This is no mere insult. This is humiliation writ in ash. And there is only one answer: blood, flame, and vengeance. Take back your hall. Cleanse it in red. Begin the path your forefather carved in gore — the path to Daemonhood.	false

ancillaries_colour_text_hkrul_grydal_banner	Woven from mammoth hide and stitched with the hair of fallen jarls, this tattered war-banner once flew above the Hall of the Snaegr before Skaeling treachery blackened its walls.
