unit_description_historical_texts_text_hkrul_geimdall	Geimdall stands as the right hand of High King Ulfric Grondal, a warrior of peerless skill and unwavering loyalty. Raised in the storm-lashed holds of the Bjornlings, he fought his first battle before he could grow a beard, carving out his place among the huscarls with axe and shield. Over the years, his name became legend among his kin, not merely for his prowess in war, but for his wisdom in matters of blood and steel. To the Bjornling huscarls, the elite guard of their war-kings, Geimdall is more than a war leader—he is a spiritual guide, the one who reminds them of their sacred duty to fight, raid, and die with honor.His devotion to Ulfric is absolute, for he sees in the High King the will of the gods made manifest. He has led countless expeditions across the Sea of Claws, raiding the soft lands of the south and returning with treasures, thralls, and war-stories told over roaring fires. Yet, his ambitions do not end with mere plunder. Geimdall dreams of conquest, of carving out a Bjornling dominion beyond the waves. His gaze is fixed upon Bretonnia—a land of weak men hiding behind high walls and chivalric lies. He sees their knights not as noble warriors, but as prey waiting to be brought low. One day, he swears, the Bjornling banners will fly over their stone keeps, and the sagas will tell of how Geimdall led the north to claim its rightful place in the south.	false
