incidents_localised_description_rhox_fc_norsca_swyrd_incident	In the dire aftermath of the battlefield, when defeat's bitter taste lingers, a haunting caw pierces the desolation. As shadows dance with the fading light, the Ravenswyrd emerges from the ethereal mists, his silhouette a beacon of hope. A lone raven circles overhead, its ebony wings a shield against impending doom. With an otherworldly presence, the Ravenswyrd stands amidst the fallen, a living legend summoned by the gods to turn the tide of destiny. As he raises his weapon, a surge of primal energy courses through the beleaguered warriors, and a whisper on the wind foretells that even in the darkest hour, the Ravenswyrd shall stand guardian until the End of all things.	false
