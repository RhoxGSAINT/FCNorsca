ancillaries_colour_text_hkrul_eyri_axe	Eyri Goldfinger’s infamous twin axes — Coincleavers — are as symbolic as they are deadly. Forged by a disgraced dwarf runesmith deep in the fjords of Norsca, the blades were once part of an unbreakable lockbox made to guard royal tithes. Eyri slew the smith, melted down the box, and reforged it into weapons that would "unlock" the riches of others.	true

unit_description_historical_texts_text_hkrul_eyri	Eyri Goldfinger, self-styled Lord of Eyristaad, is as much a merchant as he is a raider — the distinction, to him, is simply one of formality. Though sworn to High King eyri Grondal as a loyal Bjornling, he operates on the fringe of loyalty, brokering deals across the Sea of Claws and skimming war profits with equal delight. His cunning tongue and quick blades have earned him both coin and contempt in equal measure.	false

effect_bundles_localised_description_hkrul_eyri_faction_trait	In Eyristaad, loyalty is bought, sold, and often bartered for salted fish. Goldfinger’s wealth has kept the trolls fed, the ships floating, and the blades sharpened. Some claim he’s struck secret pacts with foreign lords, or even daemons. Eyri denies it all — while sipping Bretonnian brandy and calculating interest on war.	false

ancillaries_colour_text_hkrul_eyri_crown	This banner is stitched from coastal sailcloth dyed deep grey-blue, flecked with blood-rust and frayed by sea spray. Its sigil — a golden kraken clutching a balance scale — marks it unmistakably as the flag of Eyristaad and the Goldfinger fleet. To Eyri’s men, it is a symbol of opportunity. Where it flies, coin flows and enemies bleed. To his rivals, it is the promise of treachery — for this banner is raised not in honour or loyalty, but in pursuit of gain.	false

frontend_faction_leaders_loading_screen_text_cr_oldworld_political_party_nor_eyristaad	In the shadow of Kronfjall’s lightning-crowned peak, where gold is weighed as heavily as blood, Eyri Goldfinger plots beneath a cloak of loyalty. A sworn vassal to High King Grondal in word alone, Eyri barters silver and secrets across the Sea of Claws, weaving coin into power while the High King sleeps. But the north burns—Icefang raiders, draped in frost and madness, descend upon Eyristaad’s borders with cold fury in their eyes. Between fire and frost, Eyri sharpens his twin axes, knowing one truth above all: loyalty is for fools, but wealth buys everything... even kingship.	false

unit_description_historical_texts_text_hkrul_godi	There are trolls, and then there is Grompf — a regenerating, battle-scarred beast who has served Eyri Goldfinger longer than most mercenaries keep their limbs. Towering over men and stinking of algae, Grompf is no ordinary lackey; he is a walking siege weapon, a living reminder of Eyri's recklessness and genius. 'Killed' more times than anyone cares to count, Grompf simply gets back up again, his flesh knitting back together with horrifying ease. Though utterly dim-witted, he has a primitive loyalty to Eyri, often dragging spoils — or prisoners — to his master like a slobbering hound.	false

incidents_localised_description_hkrul_eyri_turn_two_incident	From the steep, storm-lashed slopes of Kronfjall, Eyri Goldfinger casts his gaze southward. His network of raiders, traders, and smugglers spreads like salt on the wind—seeping into coastal towns, choking trade routes, and buying loyalty where axes alone will not do. Though he speaks oaths to High King Grondal, Eyri builds an empire of coin and cunning, where longships carry timber one way and plunder the other. The Icefang grow restless in the north, and Grondal's suspicions fester—but opportunity lies ahead, and Eyri intends to seize it before either threat closes in.	false

ancillaries_colour_text_hkrul_eyri_banner	Stitched from sailcloth soaked in brine and battle, this banner bears the golden kraken of Eyristaad clutching a balance scale—coin and axe held in equal weight. Salt-encrusted and fraying, it has flown above merchant convoys, sacked ports, and drowned fortresses alike. To Eyri’s allies, it is a promise of profit; to his enemies, a warning that diplomacy may yet come... before the fire. Wherever this standard rises, trade flows, treaties unravel, and someone always ends up paying the price.	true
