ancillaries_colour_text_hkrul_eyri_axe	Eyri Goldfinger’s infamous twin axes — Coincleavers — are as symbolic as they are deadly. Forged by a disgraced dwarf runesmith deep in the fjords of Norsca, the blades were once part of an unbreakable lockbox made to guard royal tithes. Eyri slew the smith, melted down the box, and reforged it into weapons that would "unlock" the riches of others.	true

unit_description_historical_texts_text_hkrul_eyri	Eyri Goldfinger, self-styled Lord of Eyristaad, is as much a merchant as he is a raider — the distinction, to him, is simply one of formality. Though sworn to High King eyri Grondal as a loyal Bjornling, he operates on the fringe of loyalty, brokering deals across the Sea of Claws and skimming war profits with equal delight. His cunning tongue and quick blades have earned him both coin and contempt in equal measure.	false

effect_bundles_localised_description_hkrul_eyri_faction_trait	In Eyristaad, loyalty is bought, sold, and often bartered for salted fish. Goldfinger’s wealth has kept the trolls fed, the ships floating, and the blades sharpened. Some claim he’s struck secret pacts with foreign lords, or even daemons. Eyri denies it all — while sipping Bretonnian brandy and calculating interest on war.	false

effects_description_hkrul_eyri_crown	Ability: "Standard of Salt and Coin"	false
ancillaries_colour_text_hkrul_eyri_crown	This banner is stitched from coastal sailcloth dyed deep grey-blue, flecked with blood-rust and frayed by sea spray. Its sigil — a golden kraken clutching a balance scale — marks it unmistakably as the flag of Eyristaad and the Goldfinger fleet. To Eyri’s men, it is a symbol of opportunity. Where it flies, coin flows and enemies bleed. To his rivals, it is the promise of treachery — for this banner is raised not in honour or loyalty, but in pursuit of gain.	false
