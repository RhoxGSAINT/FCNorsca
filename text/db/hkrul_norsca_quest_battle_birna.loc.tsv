battle_set_pieces_localised_name_hkrul_sarl_birna_bogtusk_final_battle	Monster Hunt: The Mire-Damned Colossus	false
battle_set_pieces_localised_description_hkrul_sarl_birna_bogtusk_final_battle	The salt-crusted bogs of the Kalti Delta churn and seethe, and the mist stinks of rotted flesh. The trail of broken trees and crushed bones ends here, where the ancient monster stirs. Mogwrath the Bogtusk rises from his muck-lair, drawn by the horn-blasts of the Sarl and the iron will of Birna herself. There will be no retreat. No respite. Only the clash of bone, tusk, and steel in a mire that drinks the blood of both hunter and hunted. Today, a legend of the salt marshes dies—or a legend of the Sarl is born.	false
loading_screen_quotes_description_hkrul_sarl_birna_bogtusk_final_battle	The Kalti Delta is no place for men or gods. It is a land of brine, decay, and drowning dreams. But it is here that Birna, Huntress of the Sarl, must face the oldest terror of the marshes—Mogwrath the Bogtusk. The beast is not simply flesh and fury; it is the spirit of the Delta made monstrous, a towering curse of salt, mud, and endless hunger. To fell it is to carve her name into the very bones of the land itself. She does not fight for coin, nor for glory. She fights because none else can.	false

missions_localised_description_hkrul_sarl_birna_bogtusk_final_battle	In the heart of the Kalti Delta, the mire heaves and a monster stirs. Mogwrath the Bogtusk rises from its lair, drawn by Birna’s challenge. Here, in the blood-choked marshes, hunter and beast will meet. Only one will leave the swamp alive.	false

incidents_localised_description_hkrul_birna_turn_two_incident	The salt winds shift. Old scars in the land open anew. The Sarl speak of Mogwrath—the Bogtusk—an ancient beast that churns the Kalti Delta into a graveyard of bone and muck. Its spoor fouls the waters. Its shadow blots the mist. If Birna would prove herself the greatest huntress of her age, the beast must fall by her hand alone. The hunt begins.	false

missions_localised_description_hkrul_sarl_birna_bogtusk_mission_1	The Kalti Delta is the heart of Sarl hunting traditions. Its mastery is essential for both survival and honour. Without it, Birna’s people cannot reclaim their place among the great tribes of Norsca.	false
missions_localised_description_hkrul_sarl_birna_bogtusk_mission_2	The marshes demand skilled hunters. Birna must gather her finest archers and trackers from the Sarl tribes to prepare for the great hunt. Their arrows will be the teeth of her campaign into the south.	false
missions_localised_description_hkrul_sarl_birna_bogtusk_mission_3	The trail leads the hunters east. Fort Jakova stands as a foreign foothold in hunting grounds that should belong to the Sarl. A brutal raid will weaken their claim and remind the world of the old ways. Blood on the snow is the only language outsiders understand.	false
missions_localised_description_hkrul_sarl_birna_bogtusk_mission_4	No hunt is complete without the fury of the beast. Birna must bind a Skinwolf to her cause, a creature born of the wilds and forged for slaughter. Their senses will be detrimental in finding the Bogtusk. Its howl will mark the true beginning of the great hunt.	false
