unit_description_historical_texts_text_hkrul_olaf	Towering over his warband, Olaf Wolfhound is both warlord and beast. His frizzled mane of red hair and twin bear pelts lend him an unholy silhouette, like some three-headed god of battle. Fueled by a ceaseless fury, Olaf commands his Skaeling kin with brutal clarity and unwavering devotion to Khorne. Each raid, each slaughter, is a hymn in blood to his patron god—and few can match his zeal.	false

ancillaries_colour_text_hkrul_olaf_axe	Crude and cruel in design, Gorehook is more a butcher’s tool than a warrior’s weapon. Forged in the black smoke of a Skaeling war-forge and quenched in the blood of thralls, the axe’s jagged crescent edge is serrated and curved inward like a beast’s fang. It does not slice cleanly—it rips, mauls, and drags. Victims struck by Gorehook are often left writhing on the ground, hamstrung or bleeding out as Olaf steps over them to find his next target.	false

ancillaries_explanation_text_hkrul_olaf_helm	Forged in exile and consecrated in blood, this mantle is crafted from the pelts of nine dire bears—one for each brutal winter Olaf endured alone in the Howling North after defying and slaying his tribe’s old chieftain. Of the nine, three were slain with bare hands beneath a blood moon, their massive skulls now mounted upon Olaf’s shoulders as a fearsome trophy. Their snarling visages frame him in battle, giving the impression of a three-headed beast rising from a blizzard of gore. The cloak never freezes, never stiffens, and seems to repel fire and poison as if nature itself dares not offend its wearer. The Warhide is more than protection—it is proof that Olaf has already survived a fate harsher than death.	false

If left without slaughter, S’iba’aht grows quiet, its power waning until it slumbers again for centuries. When awakened, it speaks not with words but with yearning: visions, rage, and urges that twist even the strongest minds. It does not ask to be wielded. It chooses.

frontend_faction_leaders_loading_screen_text_cr_oldworld_political_party_nor_snaegr	In the howling dark of Norsca’s coasts, where the wind flays skin and gods demand blood, Olaf Wolfhound marches to war—not alone, but bound in sacred slaughter to his crimson-haired bride, Tuula Bloodhair. Their union is no simple love—it is a pact forged in fury, battle, and the worship of Khorne. Together, they chase the maddening whispers of a daemon-forged spear, long thought lost, its name buried in slaughtered tongues. S’iba’aht calls to them in dreams and rage, and neither Olaf nor Tuula will rest until its thirst is quenched in oceans of gore. Let the world tremble—for where Olaf goes, so too goes Tuula, and where they walk, war follows.	false

incidents_localised_description_hkrul_olaf_turn_three_incident	The dreams no longer whisper—they roar. Olaf awakens with blood on his fists. Tuula's eyes burn with a fevered light. Crimson Rain howls from beyond the horizon, a siren cry of slaughter and promise. It is no longer a fleeting image—it is a command.

Tuula sees it in the bloodied surf, Olaf hears it in the thunder of cannon-fire. The towns of Nordland tremble beneath black sails, their priests clutching relics, their temples hiding something… perhaps the thing. The sea brings truth, and Khorne demands the price for it. Every pyre, every skull, every desecrated shrine brings Crimson Rain closer to hand. If the Empire will not give it freely, then we shall take everything.	false

The voice of the spear cries out through fire and fog, guiding their march ever southward—toward Middenheim, the Wolf-City. A priest dwells there, cloaked in lies and gold, guarding the truth of Crimson Rain. He will not speak willingly. Let his cathedral burn, let his screams echo through the mountain—let Sigmar’s stronghold become Khorne’s feast.	false

missions_localised_description_hkrul_olaf_spear_3	Crimson Rain is not merely found—it is earned. The spear is a relic of slaughter, a daemon that drinks not just blood, but the smoke of burning cities and the gold stolen from broken hands. It demands a tithe—a path of ruin paid in plunder and desecration. Villages must burn. Coffers must be cracked. Only then will the spear offer its next whisper. To follow the trail, you must leave one behind.	false

incidents_localised_description_hkrul_olaf_turn_seven_incident	The monastery lies in ruins. The spear, Crimson Rain, now rests in Olaf’s hands—dripping not with blood, but with raw, pulsing power. Within its blade, the daemon S’iba’aht stirs, no longer slumbering, but fully awake and aware. Khorne watches. A choice must be made. To bind the daemon is to master its power—Olaf remains in control, wielding the weapon as a brutal extension of his will. But to release it… is to unchain S’iba’aht's true form. A new warbringer shall rise in Olaf’s place. Flesh will melt, reality will twist—and the spear will walk.	false

Crimson Rain lies in Dreizack, sealed deep within a forgotten monastery built on holy fear and mortar-fed myths. But the spear does not whisper now—it screams. And not to Olaf alone. Willi Ziege, champion of the Empire, has heard the call. He marches not to defend—but to claim. To wield it. To cheat the Blood God of his rightful hound. There can be no sharing of this prize. No delay. The mountain must burn, and Ziege must die.	false
