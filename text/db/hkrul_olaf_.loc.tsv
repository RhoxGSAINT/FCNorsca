His frizzled mane of red hair and twin bear pelts lend him an unholy silhouette, like some three-headed god of battle. Fueled by a ceaseless fury, Olaf commands his Skaeling kin with brutal clarity and unwavering devotion to Khorne. Each raid, each slaughter, is a hymn in blood to his patron god—and few can match his zeal.	false

ancillaries_colour_text_hkrul_olaf_axe	Crude and cruel in design, Gorehook is more a butcher’s tool than a warrior’s weapon. Forged in the black smoke of a Skaeling war-forge and quenched in the blood of thralls, the axe’s jagged crescent edge is serrated and curved inward like a beast’s fang. It does not slice cleanly—it rips, mauls, and drags. Victims struck by Gorehook are often left writhing on the ground, hamstrung or bleeding out as Olaf steps over them to find his next target.	false

ancillaries_explanation_text_hkrul_olaf_helm	Forged in exile and consecrated in blood, this mantle is crafted from the pelts of nine dire bears—one for each brutal winter Olaf endured alone in the Howling North after defying and slaying his tribe’s old chieftain. Of the nine, three were slain with bare hands beneath a blood moon, their massive skulls now mounted upon Olaf’s shoulders as a fearsome trophy. Their snarling visages frame him in battle, giving the impression of a three-headed beast rising from a blizzard of gore. The cloak never freezes, never stiffens, and seems to repel fire and poison as if nature itself dares not offend its wearer. The Warhide is more than protection—it is proof that Olaf has already survived a fate harsher than death.	false

Their union is no simple love—it is a pact forged in fury, battle, and the worship of Khorne. Together, they chase the maddening whispers of a daemon-forged spear, long thought lost, its name buried in slaughtered tongues. S’iba’aht calls to them in dreams and rage, and neither Olaf nor Tuula will rest until its thirst is quenched in oceans of gore.

ancillaries_colour_text_hkrul_crimson_rain_1	Forged beneath blood-lit skies during a moon-time of frenzy, Crimson Rain is no ordinary relic — it is a vessel of Khorne’s wrath. A bone spike bound in rusted iron and soaked in warrior’s lifeblood, it drips eternally, though no wound feeds it.

Ever since, the relic weeps droplets of boiling crimson ichor — not blood, but the daemon’s fury made manifest. When carried into battle, it shrieks in voiceless rage, stirring nearby warriors into berserk fervour. To wield it is to channel a sliver of S’iba’aht’s undying wrath… though its bearer risks being claimed by the daemon’s whispered promises.	true
