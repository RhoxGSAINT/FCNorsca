ancillaries_colour_text_hkrul_einar_sword	Wielding the honor-laden title of Jarl of Vinnskor and standing proudly among the Baersonlings, Tulkir bears the weight of three decades of relentless battle on his broad shoulders. At his side, a once-magnificent blade known as Fangwyrm, now halved in valor, narrates tales of the Jarl's unyielding resilience. This magnificent weapon, snapped to less than half its former glory in the clash against the bloodbeast of the Aeslings, found renewed purpose as Einarr Sigdansson, a mighty Champion among the Baersonlings, reforged it.

The scribblings upon them bind powerful magics into the pages, waiting to be unlocked by any who might claim them. Where they came from or why they litter the fields of war remains a mystery, yet one thing is for certain: every word brims with the Changer's arcane power. If the culprits behind this flurry of spells are ever to be located, questions must be asked. Perhaps those captured in battle may have tales to tell us?	false

It seems the Blue Scribes of Tzeentch – P'tarix and Xirat'p – are the frenzied force behind the haphazard magics that have plagued so many battlefields across the land. Better yet, a clue to their current location has now reared its head, as Chaos surges within a nearby settlement.

missions_localised_description_rhox_baersonling_tze_aekold_helbrass_stage_1_nor	Word has spread of a noble’s son, a once-great Knight of the Empire, who roams the Chaos Wastes in search of a greater purpose. Most remarkably he bears the insignia of a Tzeentchian cult, the Brethren of the Golden Eagle. His loyalties had him pursued doggedly for a time by the Templars of Sigmar, the Empire’s Witch Hunters, but once they caught up he proved his status as the greatest swordsman in his Knightly Order. Perhaps in time this Champion-in-the-making will make his way to us, but in the meantime we must ensure there are more like-minded warriors to help him embrace Chaos.	false

Yet standing between the Knight and the answers leading him to Chaos’ embrace is a bloodthirsty Doombull and his warherd! If this warrior is ever to reach his full potential in Tzeentch’s estimations we must provide him with the assistance he might require to reach the revelations he seeks.	false
