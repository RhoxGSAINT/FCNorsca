ancillaries_colour_text_hkrul_goftur_sword	Foul with salt-crust and still damp with offerings, the Brinefangs are sacred relics of the cult — twin shark-tooth sabres pulled from the rotting jaws of the Sea-Father’s first Leviathan. Bound in skin-twine and teeth, each blade was tempered not by flame, but by submersion in sacrificial blood under a new moon. Brinefangs are not forged for balance, nor elegance. They are ritual implements, designed to rip, tear, and poison.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_hkrul_goftur	Gröftur Fiskauga was not always a prophet. Once, he was merely a deep-sea scavenger — a fisher of wrecks, half-mad and soaked with brine. But after vanishing beneath the waves for thirteen days during a storm, he returned changed. His eyes — bulbous, pale, and unblinking — see truths others cannot. He claims to have stood before Mermedus, the Shark-God, and received a mission: to drown the false world above and raise a new one, barnacled and blessed. Now, he leads the Servants of Mermedus: a cult of seaborne madmen, deep-mutants, and druidic drown-priests who infest coasts and deltas with salt, rot, and ruin.	false

unit_description_historical_texts_text_hkrul_mermedus	Once a sodden prophet muttering gospels to the tide, Gröftur Fiskauga now is the tide. His body has twisted under the unholy eye of Mermedus, swollen with seawater, layered with slick hide, and crowned with jagged fins. His head has taken the shape of a monstrous shark — all teeth, hate, and hunger — and his voice no longer carries riddles, but thunder. Gone is the slouching preacher; in his place stands a creature of the deep: scaled, gilled, and cloaked in seawrack. He walks with the weight of the ocean behind him, smashing through formations like a living tempest. Each swing of his coral-laced weapon leaves trails of blood and salt. He no longer spreads faith with words — he spreads it through devastation.	false

ancillaries_onscreen_name_hkrul_goftur_token	Teeth of the Tenth Tide	false
ancillaries_colour_text_hkrul_goftur_token	This necklace bears ten ancient shark teeth, each yellowed, jagged, and inscribed with glyphs only the drowned can read. The Tenth Tide refers to a ritual massacre in the age before maps, where ten longships full of thralls were dragged beneath the waves as an offering to Mermedus. None returned. But the next morning, the tide delivered these teeth to shore — perfectly arranged in the shape of a maw. Woven into sinew cord and soaked in sacred brine, the Teeth of the Tenth Tide pulse with the rhythm of the sea. When worn, the air grows wet and heavy, and whispers are heard through conch and foam. The relic is a mark of divine favour — and a warning. To wear it is to be seen by Mermedus.	false

unit_description_short_texts_text_hkrul_shark_2	Blessed by the Sea-Father to endure, to crush, and to drag down.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_hkrul_shark_2	Harrowfin is no ordinary sea-beast. It is said to have been born not of reef or womb, but of prayer — a living monument to the durability and cruelty of the deep. With a skull shaped like a wave-worn anvil and hide like blackened reef-stone, Harrowfin swims through battle with eerie calm. Blades glance off its barnacled skin. Harpoons snap. Even fire struggles to leave a mark.	false

land_units_onscreen_name_hkrul_shark_3	Maulkern the Ravager	true
unit_description_short_texts_text_hkrul_shark_3	Named after the whirlpool it once emerged from. Its bulk turns tides. Its hunger empties coasts.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_hkrul_shark_3	Maulkern is no mere sea-beast. It is a nightmare dredged from the crushing dark beneath the western ice trenches, where not even daemons dare swim. First sighted when it rose from a seething whirlpool — the Maulkern Pit — and swallowed an entire Bjornling longship whole, it has since become the whispered terror of sailors and prophets alike.	false
effect_bundles_localised_description_hkrul_goftur_faction_trait	From salt-stung cliffs and kelp-choked halls, they rise bearing the Sea-Father’s creed. Their blades drip brine and sacrifice; their prayers drown louder than storm or surf. They do not trade. They do not build. They drag the world back to the deep. Mermedus calls — and the tide answers in blood.	false

Shattered hulls lie twisted like bones beneath the waves, the wreckage of Elven skycutters, Bretonnian warships, and black-flagged pirates alike — all claimed by the Sea-Father’s hunger. Here, in this salt-choked tomb of empires, Gröftur Fiskauga begins his sacred hunt. From the decks of his kelp-bound fleet, he watches as rival sea-lords arrive, daring to plunder Mermedus’ domain. But the sharks stir. The tide thickens. And blood is promised. Gröftur does not conquer — he drags the world down, one vessel at a time. The Deepgod waits. Feed him.	false

incidents_localised_description_hkrul_goftur_turn_two_incident	The tide is thick with salt and portent. Fish beach themselves. Waves crash against the rocks in unnatural rhythms. Mermedus watches — not as a god content with prayer, but as a predator awaiting tribute. Your fleet is ready. Your sharks are hungry. Now is the time to begin the rites of offering. Sink the unworthy. Drown the landborn. Spread his shadow like an oil slick across the sea. Earn his favour — or vanish beneath it.	false
