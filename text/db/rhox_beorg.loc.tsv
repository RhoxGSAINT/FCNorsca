frontend_faction_leaders_loading_screen_text_mixer_nor_beorg	Beorg Bearstruck, a shapeshifter touched by the primal essence, carries the dual blessing and curse of bearstricken transformation. When the need arises, he morphs into a towering bear, a force of nature that strikes terror into the hearts of his foes. His warriors, the fearsome bearmen of Urslo, rally with growls and gnarls, ready to follow their chieftain southward. With every victorious conquest, Beorg's feral aura beckons feral ursine creatures to his banners. Mindless yet fierce, these feral bears join the relentless march, adding an untamed ferocity to the chaos Beorg aims to unleash. As he strings victories, the wilds respond, and the shapeshifter of Urslo's fury becomes an unstoppable force of devastation and primal might.	false
