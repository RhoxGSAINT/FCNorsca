unit_description_short_texts_text_hkrul_haraldur	A towering killer and rallying symbol, Haraldur is the wrath of the shieldwall made flesh.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_hkrul_haraldur	Among the Huscarls of the Bjornling, none loom larger — physically or in legend — than Haraldur. Towering, shaven-headed, and scarred by countless battles, he is a walking fortress armed with a massive spear and unshakable resolve. Where High Jarl Geimdall is the mind of the shieldwall, Haraldur is its fist, its hammer-blow, its answer to any insult. Few words pass his lips, but when they do, Huscarls march faster, and warriors grip their weapons tighter.	false

ancillaries_onscreen_name_hkrul_haraldur_sword	The Fellhewer	false
ancillaries_colour_text_hkrul_haraldur_sword	Fellhewer is no ornate relic, no daemon-forged abomination, nor dwarfen rune-thrust marvel — it is brutal Norscan craftsmanship at its most primal. A spear of ashwood thick as a man's forearm, its tip is a jagged shard of wyrdstone-steel, hammered flat with the weight of storms and sharpened on glacier-stone. It bears no inscriptions, only deep battle-notches and dark stains that no sea can wash away. Forged long ago in the Bjornling tribe's coastal forge-pits, it was intended as a ship-spear to slay sea serpents and krakens that threatened the longships. But in Haraldur's hand, it found new purpose — hurled from behind the shieldwall, it has ended trolls, shaggy mammoths, and worse. Some say it chooses when to strike, not Haraldur, for he only throws when death is already near.	false

ancillaries_onscreen_name_hkrul_haraldur_shield	Shield of Wyr-Stone	false
ancillaries_colour_text_hkrul_haraldur_shield	Fashioned from a slab of wyr-stone scavenged from the ruins of a Chaos-tainted keep, this shield is heavier than most men can lift. Runes of warding and endurance line its battered face, their glow dulled by age but not by function. Haraldur used it to withstand a firewyrm’s breath during a raid in the east, and since then, the shield has become a symbol of steadfastness and defiance. Those who strike it claim to hear whispers — the voice of the wyrm whose flame could not burn it.	false

ancillaries_onscreen_name_hkrul_haraldur_tankard	Foambeard’s Draught	false
ancillaries_colour_text_hkrul_haraldur_tankard	Plundered from the wreck of the Deepwhisker, this iron-bound tankard once sloshed on the belt of Skarrik Foambeard, the infamous Dwarf privateer who roamed the Sea of Claws in the age of salt and steel. The brew within — a thick, sea-aged ale flavoured with barnacle sap and powdered coral — somehow still refills after every battle, whether Haraldur wills it or not. Its warmth steadies the hand and hollows the fear, emboldening Haraldur with the strength of old sea-raiders past.	false
