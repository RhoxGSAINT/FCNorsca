unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh_dlc08_unit_long_text_nor_scm_norsca_huern	On a cold and perilous Rúnanótt (or “Geheimnisnacht,” as the southerners call it), a dying thrall fled into the tundra to give birth. Her wails were loud and lonely, but her efforts bore fruit — her babe’s first breath was full of ice, and Huern was welcomed into the world by the distant howling of wolves. How the boy survived is a matter of speculation, as are his origins. Some say his father was a thrall, others a chieftain. Many, however, claim he is the offspring of Olric himself, and that the Winter Wolf carried him to safety that fateful night. Regardless, it is true that the blood of a wolf runs through Huern’s veins. A Skin Wolf since birth, Huern has mastered his feral and savage appetites, channeling the beast’s bloodlust against his foes. His ferocity and prowess have become a local legend, drawing other skin wolves and werekin to his banner. For now, the Tribe of the Wolf rules the Naglfari Plain, hunting across its mountains and tundra. Yet greater prey lives beyond the Tribe’s lands – perhaps it is time to begin the Hunt?	false

The ultimate ambition of a Marauder is to die fighting under the gaze of the Dark Gods, or otherwise become worthy and powerful enough to travel to the far north to face their judgement directly. Individuals strong enough to walk that path emerge only occasionally: Marauder Champions, who fight and kill with more skill and ferocity than their brethren, and so gain a higher status in their warrior hierarchies. The otherworldly rewards are not always clear, however – these standout fighters epitomise both the glory and the risk of seeking the attention of the Dark Gods, treading along a knife’s edge between immortality and oblivion.	false

unit_description_historical_texts_text_wolftribe_unit_long_text_nor_wolftribe_nor_inf_wolf_champions_ror_0	Aspiring Champions are often the best any Chaos Warrior can hope to become, since the unending peril of fighting in a Chaos host means that few progress any higher. Those who achieve champion status will eliminate anyone they see as competition, butchering any promising underlings to ensure their continued station in their God’s hordes. As a result, many form their own warbands until they achieve their goals or meet their end by the blade of a rival. Those on this long and often doomed path are obsessed individuals, only recalling the most pertinent details of their past, and many assume new identities to replace those lost to them.	false
