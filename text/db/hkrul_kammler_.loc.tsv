unit_description_historical_texts_text_hkrul_kammler	Ernst von Kammler, once a mortal sorcerer of the Empire, vanished beyond the Frozen Sea in pursuit of secrets buried in the Chaos Wastes. There, he found the Soul-Eater — a crystalline prison of impossible knowledge and shifting lies. Bound to it for years, he became its guardian and victim, twisted by Tzeentch’s will. His liberation came at the hands of Einarr Steelfist, though whether this was salvation or manipulation is still unclear. Now he serves not through loyalty, but through the certainty that this path leads to destiny — or damnation.	false
