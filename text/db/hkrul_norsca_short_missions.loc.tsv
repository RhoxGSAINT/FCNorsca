missions_localised_description_hkrul_skeggi_adella_sword_final	In the heart of Lustria's dense jungle, Adella of the Thousand Mouths, a Norscan Queen gifted with chaotic whispers, seeks the legendary "Sword of Warping" to unleash chaos against the Lizardmen. With a cadre of loyal marauders, she ventures inland for the final quest battle, the jungle humming with anticipation as Adella prepares to seize the Sword and face the cold-blooded defenders in a decisive struggle that will echo through the ancient jungle.	false

missions_localised_title_hkrul_bjornling_ulfric_crown_final_battle	The Crown of Skjold	false
missions_localised_description_hkrul_bjornling_ulfric_crown_final_battle	The frozen shores of Skjold, once a bastion of Norscan strength, now bear witness to the looming storm on the horizon. Ulfric Grondal, High King of the Bjornling Tribe, learns of a relentless menace approaching his domain, a shadow from his past turned seafaring legend—Aranessa Saltspite. Rumors of his mutant daughter's return reach the ears of tribes already swayed by doubts about his rule. With the mantle of leadership hanging by a thread, Ulfric faces an unavoidable reckoning. He cannot allow Aranessa's piracy to undermine his authority any further. To reclaim the respect of his jarls and huskarls, he must confront the wayward daughter he once cast into the abyss. As the frigid wind howls and the unforgiving sea churns, Ulfric Grondal rides to the icy shores, a realm he must defend to retain his high kingship. The burden of a father's choice and the weight of an unspoken fate converge in this bitter conflict. The battlefield becomes the crucible in which Ulfric aims to sever the ties that bind him to the pirate queen and reassert his claim as the one true High King of the Bjornling Tribe.	false

unit_description_short_texts_text_hkrul_boartusk_boss	An ancient horror, Mogwrath wallows beneath the Kalti Delta's salted marshes, stirring only to feed or to kill.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_hkrul_boartusk_boss	Few beasts have rooted themselves so deeply into the fear-etched songs of the Sarl tribes as Mogwrath the Bogtusk. Said to have thundered forth from the depths of the mire in the First Winter, when the Kalti Delta first turned brackish, Mogwrath is a blighted fusion of mammoth and swamp-boar—its hide pocked with barnacles, its tusks eroded and re-formed by the salt tides of a thousand years. Some seers claim it is a daemon-bound relic of the Great Maw, while others speak of a primal godlet, banished and cursed to drown forever in muck and memory.	false
unit_description_short_texts_text_hkrul_ziege	A veteran of a hundred wars, Ziege's blade thirsts as fiercely as he does.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_hkrul_ziege	Willi Ziege is no common sellsword. Among mercenaries of the Empire, his name is spoken with reverence and fear. He has stood in shieldwalls broken by Beastmen, led forlorn charges through Druchii bolts, and faced necromantic horrors without flinching. Battle is his prayer; the clash of blades, his litany.	false
dilemmas_localised_title_bjornling_dilemma_1	The Mutant of the Wharf	false
dilemmas_localised_description_bjornling_dilemma_1	Lars, the finest apprentice shipwright in a generation — and Hafskael’s own — has been discovered to bear signs of mutation. Faint webbing between his fingers. Eyes that glint just a shade too bright in the dark. Word spreads quickly through the wharf, and soon up to the longhall. Among the Bjornlings, such deformity is not tolerated, no matter the man’s worth. Tradition is clear: mutants are cast from the Cliffs of Skjold to the sea below — death by waves, witnessed by kin. Yet Lars is invaluable, his designs have kept Bjornling ships unchallenged.	false

effect_bundles_localised_description_hkrul_grydal_momentum	With the Hall reclaimed and the stain of Skaeling insult washed away in gore, the Snaegr march with purpose once more. Spears are gripped tighter. War cries ring louder. Every warrior knows their jarl walks the path to godhood — and they will spill oceans of blood to see it done.	false
dilemmas_localised_title_bjornling_dilemma_fish_overload	The Spoil of Plenty	false
dilemmas_localised_description_bjornling_dilemma_fish_overload	The fish holds are full to bursting — barrels creak, the smell turns sharp, and gulls gather in screaming flocks. What was once a bounty is now on the edge of spoil. Do you sell the surplus, feed the warbands, or share the sea’s reward with your oarsmen? Delay too long, and even the finest catch will rot in the sun.	false
