missions_localised_title_hkrul_bjornling_ulfric_crown_final_battle	The Crown of Skjold	false
missions_localised_description_hkrul_bjornling_ulfric_crown_final_battle	The frozen shores of Skjold, once a bastion of Norscan strength, now bear witness to the looming storm on the horizon. Ulfric Grondal, High King of the Bjornling Tribe, learns of a relentless menace approaching his domain, a shadow from his past turned seafaring legend—Aranessa Saltspite. Rumors of his mutant daughter's return reach the ears of tribes already swayed by doubts about his rule. With the mantle of leadership hanging by a thread, Ulfric faces an unavoidable reckoning. He cannot allow Aranessa's piracy to undermine his authority any further. To reclaim the respect of his jarls and huskarls, he must confront the wayward daughter he once cast into the abyss. As the frigid wind howls and the unforgiving sea churns, Ulfric Grondal rides to the icy shores, a realm he must defend to retain his high kingship. The burden of a father's choice and the weight of an unspoken fate converge in this bitter conflict. The battlefield becomes the crucible in which Ulfric aims to sever the ties that bind him to the pirate queen and reassert his claim as the one true High King of the Bjornling Tribe.	false

unit_description_short_texts_text_hkrul_boartusk_boss	An ancient horror, Mogwrath wallows beneath the Kalti Delta's salted marshes, stirring only to feed or to kill.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_hkrul_boartusk_boss	Few beasts have rooted themselves so deeply into the fear-etched songs of the Sarl tribes as Mogwrath the Bogtusk. Said to have thundered forth from the depths of the mire in the First Winter, when the Kalti Delta first turned brackish, Mogwrath is a blighted fusion of mammoth and swamp-boar—its hide pocked with barnacles, its tusks eroded and re-formed by the salt tides of a thousand years. Some seers claim it is a daemon-bound relic of the Great Maw, while others speak of a primal godlet, banished and cursed to drown forever in muck and memory.	false
unit_description_short_texts_text_hkrul_ziege	A veteran of a hundred wars, Ziege's blade thirsts as fiercely as he does.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_hkrul_ziege	Willi Ziege is no common sellsword. Among mercenaries of the Empire, his name is spoken with reverence and fear. He has stood in shieldwalls broken by Beastmen, led forlorn charges through Druchii bolts, and faced necromantic horrors without flinching. Battle is his prayer; the clash of blades, his litany.	false
