battle_set_pieces_localised_description_hkrul_baerson_einar_bubos	At the edge of the Lake of Rot, Einarr Sigdansson faces his greatest trial. Bubos, Nurgle’s ancient wyrm, rises from the tainted waters to block the path to the Palace of Plagues. Its breath rots steel, its wings spread corruption, and its bloated body bears the weight of a thousand dying worlds. To reach the heart of Nurgle’s domain and claim the artifact promised by Tzeentch, Einarr must bring down the foul beast. Victory or death—there is no other fate upon these poisoned shores.	false

loading_screen_quotes_description_hkrul_baerson_einar_bubos_player	Through blood, ice, and madness, Einarr Sigdansson has carved a path deep into the Wastes, his people hardened by horrors beyond mortal reckoning. Now, before the rotted gates of Nurgle’s Palace, a final guardian rises — Bubos, the festering wyrm of the Lake of Rot. It is no mortal beast that blocks the way, but a creature bloated on plague and blasphemy, ancient and monstrous. Its wings drip with corruption; its breath withers flesh and steel alike. There can be no retreat, no second chance. Slay the dragon, or perish in the filth of a false god’s domain. The Palace lies beyond... but so does the final test of will, faith, and vengeance.	false

unit_description_historical_texts_text_hkrul_bubos_boss	Bubos is an ancient, plague-ridden dragon, swollen with Nurgle’s blessings and reeking of death. His foul breath carries diseases that can rot an army before a blade is drawn, and his very flesh weeps corruption.	false

battle_set_pieces_localised_description_hkrul_baerson_einar_aesling	They came screaming out of the white — Aesling raiders with axes alight in the red dawn. Einarr stands alone in this dreamscape, surrounded by flickering phantoms of those he could not save. Among them, the bloodbeast that tore his wife from the world. But dreams are not only torment — they are crucibles. Let Einarr’s anguish be sharpened into wrath. He struck at its hide again and again, but not even vengeance could raise the dead.	false

Vinnskor lives again in dream, but death walks its alleys once more. In the hush before slaughter, Einarr sees himself powerless, his blade heavy, his cries drowned in silence. This is no simple memory — it is prophecy inverted, a lesson etched in blood and regret. He ran to her side — too slow, too late — and the beast was already feeding.	false

unit_description_historical_texts_text_hkrul_skraevold	The Bloodbeast of Skraevold is no mere monster, but a spawn of Chaos gifted to the Aeslings during one of their bloodiest raids. Towering over men, with sinew taut as steel and fur matted with the gore of a hundred feasts, it tore through the village of Vinnskor like an avatar of Khorne. There, it slew Einarr’s wife before his eyes, the memory of her lifeless body forever seared into his soul. Since that day, the beast has haunted his dreams, and perhaps — in some cursed corner of reality — still walks.	false

unit_description_historical_texts_text_hkrul_skoroth_boss	Skoroth the Plaguelord was once a mortal priest of Nurgle, festering in the ruins of a thousand failed empires. Now he is something more — a bloated, glistening prophet of decay who strides through battlefield and village alike, spreading disease not with fury but with absolute devotion. He does not roar. He speaks softly, with breath thick as swamp gas. Around him, crops wilt, walls flake, and men sicken. He has survived wounds that would fell giants, not through strength but by refusing to die — and teaching others to do the same, painfully.	false

Einarr has come not for conquest, but reckoning — to destroy the daemon who defiled his lands and dreams. The gate will not open to steel alone. Madness waits within.	false

missions_localised_description_hkrul_baerson_einar_palace_battle	There is no glory left in him. No war-song to howl, no kin to hear it. Only red snow, running bile, and the clawing truth that this was never vengeance — only inevitability. Einarr marches not toward triumph, but to the end of his line, his legacy, and himself. At the edge of the Plaguelord’s domain, the knife begins to turn.	false
loading_screen_quotes_description_hkrul_baerson_einar_skoroth_player	The air congeals like spoiled milk, thick with pestilent vapors and the stench of unmaking. Einarr knows what waits — not just death, but the truth. Before the gates of the Plaguelord's palace, he must carve through waves of the wretched, the bloated, and the damned. Only then will Skoroth emerge, drawn by blood and fury, to end what fate began.	false
