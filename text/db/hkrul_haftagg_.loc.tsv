unit_description_short_texts_text_hkrul_haftagg	The Bjornlings' bloodhound — stalking on all fours, he never loses the scent	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_hkrul_haftagg	Haftagg has long ceased to resemble the man he once was. Twisted by the curse of the werekin many years past, his transformation is complete — not into a howling monster, but into something far worse: a calculating predator. His body has grown lean, his limbs adapted for movement on all fours, and his senses sharpened to uncanny acuity. While other skinwolves roar in blind rage, Haftagg watches. Waits. Stalks. Kept by the Bjornlings like one might keep a prized warhound, Haftagg is loosed when enemies must vanish, when prey must be found no matter the terrain, or when whispers in the dark are answered with tearing flesh. None escape his nose. None survive once marked.	false
