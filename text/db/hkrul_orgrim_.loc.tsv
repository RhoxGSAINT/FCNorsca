unit_description_historical_texts_text_hkrul_orgrim	Once a member of the dreaded Aesling tribe, Orgrim was cast out for a crime none dare speak aloud — a betrayal so bitter it turned blood against blood. He did not die in exile. He became something worse. Through frost and madness, Orgrim’s soul twisted with the hunger of the wolf. Now a werekin, he walks the snow as both man and beast, tracking the scent of his former kin across the north. His fangs find the throat of every Aesling he hunts. For Einarr Sigdansson, he is a loyal companion. For the Aeslings, he is the nightmare behind every blizzard howl.	false
