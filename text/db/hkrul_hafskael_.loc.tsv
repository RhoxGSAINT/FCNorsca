unit_description_historical_texts_text_hkrul_hafskael	Where lesser jarls seek plunder, Hafskael builds legacies. Through port, pier, and prow, he has turned a meagre coastal village into a maritime superpower. With his enchanted hammer — a relic said to be forged in the furnace of a drowned god — he brings the might of the sea to every battle. Longships led by Hafskael strike like waves upon a cliff, relentless and crushing.	false

ancillaries_colour_text_hkrul_hafskael_axe	Simple in make, brutal in purpose. Dockiron bears no ornate sigils or runes — only the scars of years spent raising piers and collapsing skulls. Once a tool for driving mooring stakes into hard stone, its dense weight and unforgiving face now serve Hafskael on the battlefield. Blood cakes the haft where pitch once clung, and every impact rings with the sound of breaking boards... or bones.	false

ancillaries_colour_text_hkrul_yngve_eye	A single polished eye-stone, cold to the touch and veined like a glacier, said to have fallen from the skull of the first giant ever slain by man — or so the skalds sing. Yngve Aarseth found it embedded in a troll mound, and since then, no Norscan giant has raised its fist in anger toward him. Instead, they stand straighter when he draws near, their brows furrowed as if in reverence… or confusion. Some whisper that the Eye doesn’t merely remind the giants of the past — it allows them to see through it.	false
