unit_description_historical_texts_text_hkrul_olg	Olg Blóðsalt is a young Skaeling captain whose name already echoes across the northern fjords and salt-scarred coastlines. At just nineteen, he bears the mark of the gods—though whether as a blessing or a curse, none can say for certain. His body is bloated and crusted with a layer of wet, clinging salt, the result of the dreaded Brine Drinker mutation. Pale-skinned and red-haired, he moves with a strange, sluggish grace, his presence both unsettling and magnetic. In battle, Olg fights with a fury born not of ambition, but of bitter resentment—resentment for the twisted gift that ages him before his time and marks him as other among his kin.	true
ancillaries_onscreen_name_hkrul_olg_axe	Brinehewer	false
ancillaries_colour_text_hkrul_olg_axe	At first glance, Brinehewer appears more like driftwood and scrap than a weapon—its haft swollen and warped by the sea, its blade mottled with rust, algae, and flaking barnacles. But in Olg Blóðsalt’s grip, the axe becomes a living extension of his cursed form. Forged long ago by a mad Skaeling blacksmith who quenched his blades in brine and blood, Brinehewer drinks deeply from every wound it inflicts. When it strikes, the corroded edge hisses, releasing bursts of caustic mist that eat away at armor and sear flesh with salt-laced agony. Legends say the axe does not merely kill—it preserves the bitterness of its victims, binding their fury into its pitted iron for the next swing. Few can stand before it twice.	false
ancillaries_colour_text_hkrul_olg_helm	The Saltmask is a corroded helm that clings to Olg Blóðsalt’s face like a second, blistered skin. Forged from bronze and iron dredged up from a sunken altar deep beneath the Kalti Delta, the mask was once a ceremonial tribute to a forgotten sea god. Now, it has fused to Olg’s features, its inner surface crusted with brine and jagged salt formations that draw blood with every breath he takes. The Saltmask reeks of damp decay and whispers with every wave, muffling Olg’s voice into a low, rasping gurgle. Yet in battle, it grants him terrifying clarity—his enemies seem sluggish and distant, like figures drowning in deep water. Some claim the mask sees for him, drawn to weakness and fear, guiding his axe toward those most ripe for ruin. Others say it hungers as he does, and that one day, it will drown him from within.	false
