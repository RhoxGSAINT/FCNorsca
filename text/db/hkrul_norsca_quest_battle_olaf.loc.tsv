battle_set_pieces_localised_description_hkrul_bloodtide_olaf_spear_final_battle	The spear no longer whispers,—it screams. As Olaf and Tuula draw closer, the sky turns crimson red - storms gather as Khorne revels in the slaughter that is to come. The trail ends here, deep in the hills of the Empire, in a forgotten monastic fortress wreathed in grey stone and sigmarite superstition. Within lies Crimson Rain, entombed in chains, surrounded by wards, and guarded by the Empire’s finest templars, witch hunters, and priests. The monastery will fall. The gods will see who is stronger—Sigmar’s martyrs or Khorne’s chosen.	false

loading_screen_quotes_description_hkrul_bloodtide_olaf_spear_final_battle	For leagues, Olaf and Tuula have carved a crimson path across the Empire—burning villages, toppling castles, tearing relics from priest and prince alike. And now, beyond these final hills, lies the monastery where the weapon waits, wrapped in chains of silver and scripture. The spear hungers. Olaf aches. Tuula grins. Crimson Rain does not wish to be found—it wishes to be wielded. Let the faithful scream. Let the walls shake. Let Sigmar’s last bastion fall beneath the wrath of Khorne’s wolves.	false
