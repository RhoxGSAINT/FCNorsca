unit_description_historical_texts_text_hkrul_usta	Usta the Witch is feared in every hall north of Troll Country, for hers is the name whispered when auguries go dark. One of the last true hag-seers of Norsca, she walks alone, wandering from coast to crater, muttering to stones and bones alike. No jarl has ever claimed her, though many have tried — those who pressed too hard now serve as stories told to frighten children. When Einarr Sigdansson saw the end in his dreams, it was Usta he sought. And when she saw his fate, she chose to walk beside it.	false
