hkrul_bloodtide_olaf_spear_final_battle	FIGHT_SET_PIECE_BATTLE	Krakens' Bane	A band of Norscan raiders have declared war upon Manann himself in the name of their Chaos Gods, slaughtering innocent creatures of the sea. The raiding parties are under orders from their Skjold chieftain, who claims that the Queen of Tides is his daughter who he’d thought dead. He had thrown Aranessa into the ocean as a baby, believing she would attract the ire of the Dark Gods due to the mutations she bore. The Skjold chieftain mobilised his fleet as soon as he learned that Aranessa was still alive, believing that by murdering as many sea creatures as possible, he could prove his rejection of Aranessa before the Gods. The Queen of Tides, favoured by Manann, will ensure both she and the Sea-God have their revenge!	nor/generic	rom_event_mission.png	false	false	Quest	hkrul_bloodtide_olaf_spear_final_battle	357	578	true	true	10.0000		true		false

hkrul_baerson_einar_bubos_battle	FIGHT_SET_PIECE_BATTLE	Pestilent Potions	It is not without reason that they say Doctor Festus’ curative powers are greater than any other who walks the world. Not that he has any interest in healing others – since being gifted intimate knowledge of disease by Father Nurgle he has been consumed by an insatiable and ruthless desire to experiment, a sliver of the Plaguelord’s boundless delight in perpetuating the cycle of life and death. Thus Festus forever seeks exotic ingredients to brew his noxious potions, frequently foraying into the Realm of Nurgle via fluctuating portals known only to him, in the hopes of harvesting something delectably vomit-inducing. He is due such an expedition, though this time he might be pleasantly surprised at what awaits him beyond the veil…	nor/generic	rom_event_mission.png	false	false	Quest	hkrul_baerson_einar_bubos	705	597	true	true	10.0000		true		false

hkrul_sarl_birna_bogtusk_mission_1	SCRIPTED	Monster Hunt: Frigustrex, Scion of the Cold-Void	With the appearance of giant, winged monsters, Chaos Frost Dragons are thought to be a type of Chaos-mutated Dragon that dwells in the underground passageways of the Old World’s coldest climes. Amongst the northern tribes there are tales of one such monstrous specimen called Frigustrex, Scion of the Cold-Void, which has terrorised the tundra for centuries. Witnesses say that when coming out of hibernation it emerges from the ground, in a heartbeat, to indiscriminately devour any unknowing passers-by that get too close to its territory, located somewhere at the frozen, northern end of Troll Country.\n\nRecently, The Tower of Khrakk and the surrounding areas north of Troll Country have been inexplicably blanketed by freakishly bad snow storms. Word also reaches you that entire tribes have disappeared from the region without a trace, reportedly perishing in the extreme weather. This is highly unusual – it is not like the hardy Northmen to succumb to the freezing elements so easily. A more likely explanation is brought to you by a few survivors who managed to escape the storm – they say that it was not the icy weather that swallowed up their fellow tribesmen, but a giant, Dragonish shadow lurking in the blinding blizzard.\n\nIf there is even the slightest chance that the fabled Frigustrex is out of hibernation and on the prowl, then further investigation is warranted. This could end up being a bountiful hunt indeed!	nor/generic	rom_event_mission.png	false	false	Quest		0	0	true	false	0.0000		true		false
