rhox_baersonling_tze_blue_scribes_stage_1_nor	CAPTURE_X_BATTLE_CAPTIVES	Parchment & Ink	Parchment has been seen falling from the skies over nearby battlefields. The scribblings upon them bind powerful magics into the pages, waiting to be unlocked by any who might claim them. Where they came from or why they litter the fields of war remains a mystery, yet one thing is for certain: every word brims with the Changer's arcane power. If the culprits behind this flurry of spells are ever to be located, questions must be asked. Perhaps those captured in battle may have tales to tell us?	emp/generic	rom_event_mission.png	false	false	Quest		0	0	true	false	0.0000		true		false

rhox_baersonling_tze_blue_scribes_stage_2_nor	CAPTURE_REGIONS	Parchment & Ink	Your investigation has proven fruitful, indeed. It seems the Blue Scribes of Tzeentch – P'tarix and Xirat'p – are the frenzied force behind the haphazard magics that have plagued so many battlefields across the land. Better yet, a clue to their current location has now reared its head, as Chaos surges within a nearby settlement. If you act quickly, you could capture the region before the Blue Scribes have chance to move on, spreading their twisted mischief further outside of your reach.	emp/generic	rom_event_mission.png	false	false	Quest		0	0	true	false	0.0000		true		false
rhox_baersonling_tze_blue_scribes_stage_3_nor	CONSTRUCT_N_BUILDINGS_INCLUDING	Parchment & Ink	The Blue Scribes may have just slipped your grasp, but a show of force is not the only way to entice them to your side. They have been given an impossible task in recording every fragment of magic they can find, for the possibilities have multiplied in mortal hands. Perhaps the Shamans of Chaos could offer these Wandering Wizards with assistance, and provide them a place in the mortal realm capable of housing their surplus spells.	emp/generic	rom_event_mission.png	false	false	Quest		0	0	true	false	0.0000		true		false
rhox_baersonling_tze_aekold_helbrass_stage_1_nor	CONSTRUCT_N_BUILDINGS_INCLUDING	A Tale of the True Path	Word has spread of a noble’s son, a once-great Knight of the Empire, who roams the Chaos Wastes in search of a greater purpose. Most remarkably he bears the insignia of a Tzeentchian cult, the Brethren of the Golden Eagle. His loyalties had him pursued doggedly for a time by the Templars of Sigmar, the Empire’s Witch Hunters, but once they caught up he proved his status as the greatest swordsman in his Knightly Order. Perhaps in time this Champion-in-the-making will make his way to us, but in the meantime we must ensure there are more like-minded warriors to help him embrace Chaos.	emp/generic	rom_event_mission.png	false	false	Quest		0	0	true	false	0.0000		true		false
rhox_baersonling_tze_aekold_helbrass_stage_2_nor	OWN_N_UNITS	A Tale of the True Path	The noble breath of the wandering Knight is carried as a whisper upon the Winds, speaking of a tall monolith he has encountered deep in the Chaos Wastes that holds history, magic and prophecy. Yet standing between the Knight and the answers leading him to Chaos’ embrace is a bloodthirsty Doombull and his warherd! If this warrior is ever to reach his full potential in Tzeentch’s estimations we must provide him with the assistance he might require to reach the revelations he seeks.	emp/generic	rom_event_mission.png	false	false	Quest		0	0	true	false	0.0000		true		false
