hkrul_bjornling_ulfric_crown_final_battle	FIGHT_SET_PIECE_BATTLE	Krakens' Bane	A band of Norscan raiders have declared war upon Manann himself in the name of their Chaos Gods, slaughtering innocent creatures of the sea. The raiding parties are under orders from their Skjold chieftain, who claims that the Queen of Tides is his daughter who he’d thought dead. He had thrown Aranessa into the ocean as a baby, believing she would attract the ire of the Dark Gods due to the mutations she bore. The Skjold chieftain mobilised his fleet as soon as he learned that Aranessa was still alive, believing that by murdering as many sea creatures as possible, he could prove his rejection of Aranessa before the Gods. The Queen of Tides, favoured by Manann, will ensure both she and the Sea-God have their revenge!	nor/generic	rom_event_mission.png	false	false	Quest	hkrul_bjornling_ulfric_crown_final_battle	270	579	true	true	10.0000		true		false
